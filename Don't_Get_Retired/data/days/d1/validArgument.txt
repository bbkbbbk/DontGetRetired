Hi, I am Ajarn Sun.
Welcome to Introduction to Logic class.
Logic is the study of reasoning and analysing arguments.
An argument is said to be valid if it's impossible that all the premises of the argument are true but its conclusion is false.
For example, all men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrate is mortal and all of this is a valid argument.	
I will assume that you get the idea, so here I will give you a test!
"All birds can fly and penguins cannot fly."
"Therefore, penguins are not birds."
If you think this is a valid argument go to cafeteria and buy me a drink!
Otherwise buy me a lunch...
