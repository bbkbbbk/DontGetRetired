Hello, my name is Michael.
Nice to meet you and welcome to my class.
Let me introduce you to my friend Hugo.
He is my good comrade who always cheers me up!
Electricity is everywhere!
It is just a kind of energy we created.
Today I.. oh wait what!
What happened..
The electricity is gone!
I can't continue teaching without any light!
Can you go and find ajKo and tell him that the electricity is gone please.
I think he could fix it...
